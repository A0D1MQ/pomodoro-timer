## Usage
If you want to work according to the time declared by the application, all you have to do is press "start" for the program to start counting down 25 minutes of work.
When your working time is up, you will get a notification (remember to allow notifications!) And the program will automatically start counting the short break time.
If you are determined to take a longer break, choose the "long break" option.

If you are not satisfied with the time intervals declared in the application, you can change them by pressing the settings icon.
There you can change the time of individual phases by entering the time in seconds (the time will be immediately converted into minutes to make it easier for you).
